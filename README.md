# Swift for WebAssembly Example Packages

A collection of example projects using Swift's support for [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org). To learn more, see:

- [Getting Started with Swift SDKs for WebAssembly](https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/wasm-getting-started.html)
- [WebAssembly Support in Swift Vision Document](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/visions/webassembly.md)

The repository is split into multiple subdirectories:

- The [`AudioWorkstation` package](./AudioWorkstation) demonstrates use of
  WebAssembly for application plugins;
- The [`WebGPUDemo` package](./WebGPUDemo) demonstrates use of WebAssembly
  in the browser, with Swift bindings to the [WebGPU](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/236) API.

diligently to make the Swift community welcoming to everyone.
